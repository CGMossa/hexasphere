# `hexasphere`

Library for subdividing shapes, such as an icosahedron. This provides
abstractions for almost anything to be possible, however there are many
predetermined shapes.

Note that this is a trimmed down version intended for [`bevy`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

See [`hexasphere`](https://crates.io/crates/hexasphere) for more info.
